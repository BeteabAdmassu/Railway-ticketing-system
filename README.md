# Railway-ticketing-system
 ## 1	Preliminary Investigation/Project Plan
     1.1	Introduction and Background
Railway ticketing system is designed to make the process of booking train tickets easier and more efficient. It is a computerized system developed to support the services of rail transportation. This system helps passengers in different ways, such as providing purchasing of tickets, monitoring seats availability and many more. The main purpose of this system is to provide effective and faster ticket management for travel operators, railway departments, as well as allowing customers to purchase tickets electronically.
This system also has several advantages over traditional methods like reducing wait time in queues, eliminating manual errors, fast amendment and cancellations of existing orders etc. Moreover this helps in keeping track of passenger’s details like names, contact information or other important documents etc which allows users to access these information easily whenever needed. As this system automates almost everything it makes the process easier for both travel operators as well as for the customers making it an ideal option for onboarding new customers across various platforms like online website or mobile application.
    
    1.2	Overview of the Current System 
        
The manual railway ticketing system is a system used to purchase tickets for travel on railway vehicles. It is a paper-based ticketing system in which                passengers must purchase tickets from ticket sellers on the train. The system is not used in many countries, but is still in use in some countries, such as the        Ethiopia.

    1.3	Problem/Opportunity Statement
 
A manual railway ticketing system is a railway ticketing system which is operated by an operator, such as a station attendant, without the use of a computer.          It is also known as an "on-board" ticketing system.

A manual railway ticketing system is often used on heritage railways and heritage tramways where computers are not available or not practical to use. Manual          systems are also used on some narrow gauge railways.

Manual systems are often more reliable than computer-based systems, as the computer cannot be hacked or crashed, and there is no need for a back-up system in          the event of a problem. However, manual systems can be more difficult to use, as passengers must collect tickets from the operator.
        
    1.4	Objectives of the Project
The objective of railway ticketing system is to provide a convenient and efficient way for passengers to purchase and use railway tickets.
   
    1.5	Significance of the Project
Railway ticketing is a system that allows passengers to buy tickets in advance of their journey, and to validate these tickets against a physical record at the       point of travel. The railway ticketing system is an important part of the railway infrastructure, and helps to ensure that passengers can travel safely and             without disruption.

    1.6	Scope of the Proposed System
The scope of a railway ticketing system encompasses all applications or processes associated with the booking, issuing, and reimbursement of train tickets. It covers features such as fare calculations, availability checking, and payment processing as well as reporting capabilities that provide insights into the performance of train ticket sales. The system may also feature various customer-facing interfaces for purchasing tickets online or through mobile apps.

    1.7	[Estimated Budget, Tool and Resource Requirements]
Estimated Budget: 
The estimated budget for a railway ticketing system would depend on a variety of factors such as the complexity of the system, how many stations are involved, how many types of tickets need to be processed and many more factors. As a general estimate, it may cost up to $1 million or more depending on the various requirements.

Tool and Resource Requirements: 
- Computing Hardware - Computers and servers will be needed to run the system. The hardware should be able to handle the workloads associated with ticket reservation, printing and reporting. It should also have enough storage capacity for collecting and storing data about transactions.
- Network Infrastructure - It will be necessary to connect all railway stations across the country or region through a dedicated high-speed network so that tickets can be reserved from any station in real time. This could include connecting points like routers, switches, etc., along with cables for data transmission so that customers can access railway services anytime and anywhere. 
- Database server - A separate database server will be required for robust storage and access of customer information as well as fare details associated with different routes. This is important for providing accurate and up-to-date information while processing ticket requests.
- Software - Ticketing software will be required to collect customer information such as name, contact details etc., find out fare rates and routes based on user selection, create itineraries/schedules, manage bookings as well generate marketing reports after every transaction process. There should also adequate security measures built-in protect customer’s confidential details from malicious attacks or unintended exposure.  In addition , there might also need automated payment gateway integrations some form of loyalty program management tools (optional).
    
      1.8	Tasks (WBS) and Schedule 
      1.9	Risk Management
Railway ticketing systems can be managed in a number of ways to reduce the risk of fraud and abuse. One approach is to use a centralized system, in which tickets are issued and managed centrally. This approach can be more secure, as tickets cannot be easily counterfeit or stolen. Another approach is to use a distributed system, in which tickets are issued and managed by the individual stations along the railway network. This approach can be more flexible, as stations can vary in their ticketing policies and procedures. Finally, a hybrid system can be used, in which some elements of a centralized system are used, while other elements are implemented using a distributed system.
