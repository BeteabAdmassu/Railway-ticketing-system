# Railway-ticketing-system
 ## 1	Preliminary Investigation/Project Plan
     1.1	Introduction and Background
Railway ticketing system is designed to make the process of booking train tickets easier and more efficient. It is a computerized system developed to support the services of rail transportation. This system helps passengers in different ways, such as providing purchasing of tickets, monitoring seats availability and many more. The main purpose of this system is to provide effective and faster ticket management for travel operators, railway departments, as well as allowing customers to purchase tickets electronically.
This system also has several advantages over traditional methods like reducing wait time in queues, eliminating manual errors, fast amendment and cancellations of existing orders etc. Moreover this helps in keeping track of passenger’s details like names, contact information or other important documents etc which allows users to access these information easily whenever needed. As this system automates almost everything it makes the process easier for both travel operators as well as for the customers making it an ideal option for onboarding new customers across various platforms like online website or mobile application.

  ## 2	System Analysis
    2.1	[Detail overview of the existing system] 
    2.2	Requirements Determination (you talk about what kind of method is used for requirement determination and why. The different types of sources of information relevant to the proposed system are described in detail)
      2.2.1	Functional requirements 
      2.2.2	Non-functional requirements 
    2.3	Requirements Structuring
      2.3.1	Process modeling using DFD (describe your entire DFD, starting from Context Diagram all the way down to the Primitive DFD)
      2.3.2	Logic Modeling (using either of the three logic modeling methods)
      2.3.3	Conceptual Data Modeling using ER Model
      2.3.3.1	Entity Types, Attributes and Relationships of the System
      2.3.3.2	ER Diagram
## 3	System Design
    3.1	Database design
      3.1.1	Logical database design
      3.1.2	Physical database design
    3.2	Interface design
      3.2.1	Forms and reports Design
      3.2.2	Dialogue Design


## 4	System implementation (Since developing the system is not a requirement for this project, here you’re expected to simply describe the plan of how the activities in this phase are going to be undertaken)
    4.1	Application development
    4.2	Testing
    4.3	Installation
## 5	[System support and maintenance] (The same approach is followed as in System Implementation)
    5.1	System support
    5.2	Maintenance
## 6	Conclusion and Recommendation
